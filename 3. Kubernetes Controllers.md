# Kubernetes Controllers

If one pod fails, the Replication controller helps us start another pod up in no time. This creates High Avaliability.

Controllers are also useful for load balancing. This controller helps deploy more pods and scale up the application.

Replication Controller and Replica Set are similar. Replication Controller is the oder version of Replica Set.

How can we create a Replica Set?

1. Start with a replication file with the 4 main properties (apiVersion, kind, metadata, sepc)

`apiVersion: v1 kind: ReplicationController metadata: name: myapp-rc labels: app: myapp type: front-end spec: template: metadata: name: nginx labels: app: nginx tier: frontend developer: pauline-narvas spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx`

The spec section is vital in defining what the object.

2. Add replicas section onto the YAML file. This is the amount of pods (which has been defined in the template) that you want a certain number of. Think AutoScaling groups on AWS! Similar concept.

3. Run the `kubectl create -f rc-definition.yml` command on your CLI.
