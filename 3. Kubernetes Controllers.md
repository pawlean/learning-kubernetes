# 3. Kubernetes Controllers

If one pod fails, the Replication controller helps us start another pod up in no time. This creates High Avaliability.

Controllers are also useful for load balancing. This controller helps deploy more pods and scale up the application.

Replication Controller and Replica Set are similar. Replication Controller is the oder version of Replica Set.

How can we create a Replica Set?

1. Start with a replication file with the 4 main properties (apiVersion, kind, metadata, sepc)

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController metadata:
name: myapp-rc
labels:
app: myapp
type: front-end
spec:
template:
metadata:
name: nginx
labels:
app: nginx
tier: frontend
developer: pauline-narvas spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx
```

The spec section is vital in defining what the object.

2. Add replicas section onto the YAML file. This is the amount of pods (which has been defined in the template) that you want a certain number of. Think AutoScaling groups on AWS! Similar concept.

3. Run the `kubectl create -f rc-definition.yml` command on your CLI.

4. Run `kubectl get replicationcontroller` to get a list of the replication information.

5. Run `kubectl get pods` you should see all the pods created by the replication controller. All of them will have the name of the templte and rc.

## Replica Set

Very similar to replication controller.

- apiVersion: starts with "apps/v1" rather than "v1" like what we've seen so far.
- kind: ReplicaSet
- metadata: very similar
- spec + template like replication controller
- replicas: how many pods you want spinning up?
- selector: specify which pods you want.

### Why do we need the `selector` part when we've already got the template in the spec?

Because Replica Set can also manage pods before it was created by the Replica Set.

So if you created a pod using a YAML file, the Replica set will take that pod into consideration when creating the replicas.

E.g. if you specify 3 replicas, and you've already launched 1 then it will launch 2.

```selector:
    matchLabels:
        type: front-end
```

It finds the labels that matches with what you've specified. In this case, it looks for pods with the label front-end.

Replica Set also monitors the pods, using the labels. The Replica Set know which to use.

## Useful commands

`kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yml`
To update the replicaset YAML file and scale up/down (change the replica to 3 instead of 6 for example)

`kubectl scale replicaset --replicas=6 replicaset-definition.yml`
This uses the command line, without changing the original yaml file itself.

`kubectl describe replicaset name`
Information about the replicaset
