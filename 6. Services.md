# 6. Services

Helps connect applications together
Enable connectivity between pods and external data source
Loose coupling of microservices

## Networking - External Communication

1. You have a pod in a node
2. And an external data source (outside of the node)

How do you connect these two together?

- You use a Service
- Service is like another object like pods/replica set
- A service is like a virtual server inside the node
- The service has it's own IP address

## Service Types

1. NodePort (external to pod)
2. ClusterIP (virtual ip inside cluster - back and front end services )
3. load balancer distribute load across

### Node Port

- Target port: where the service forwards the traffic to
- Port (the service port)
- NodePort (on the node)

## Definition for Service

- apiVersion: v1
- kind: Service
- metadata and name
- spec - so important that differenates from others. It is where you define the type of Service. In this case, we're specifying that we want the NodePort Service Type with a target port (on the pod) of 80, port 80 on the service and node Port of 30008.

```
spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
        - targetPort: 80
            port: 80
            nodePort: 30008
```

How do we specify which pod we're pointing to in the target port?

- You can use labels and selectors!

```
spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
        - targetPort: 80
            port: 80
            nodePort: 30008
    selector:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
        developer: paulinenarvas
```

## Useful commands

`kubectl get services`

`curl http://IP-of-the-node:3008`

## Multiple Pods - connectivity

- label all the pods
- service definition looks for a specific label
- if pods are distributed across different nodes, a service spans across all the nodes in the cluster.
