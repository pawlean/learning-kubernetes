# Service Account
- Related to Security
- CKAD exam - you only need to understand the ServiceAccount concept

### Two accounts:
1. User Account - a user e.g. Admin or Develop 
2. Service Account - Machines use this e.g. An application uses to interact with (Jenkins using it or Prometheus)

To create a Service Account, you can use the following command:
`kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard-sa`
`dashboard-ca` is the service account name

`kubectl get serviceaccount`
Lists all the service accounts

`kubectl describe serviceaccount dashboard-sa`
This describes in detail what the service account has in it. For example, it will show tokens, secrets that are needed to authenticate to Kubernetes API.


The token is a secret object. This is linked to the Serviceaccount. 

To view the token, run:
`kubectl describe secret dashboard-sa-token-kbbdm`

You can mount secrets in a Volume that lives in the same pod as the application, this allows you to just authenticate the application without needing to do any manual intervention. This is how the default serviceaccount. 

To view the contents of something in kubernetes:
`kubectl exec -it my-kubernetes-dashboard ls /filedirectory`

You can modify the service account to pod via spec: 
```
spec:
    containers: 
     - name: container-name
     image: image-name
    serviceAccount: dashboard-sa
```
You can't edit the serviceAccount, you need to delete it and restart the pod.
