# Resource Requirements

Imagine there are 3 nodes with different CPU/Memory/Disk needs. The scheduler on Kubernetes places where resources will go, if there isn't enough resource in that node, it will stay in a pending state and say something like "insufficient CPSU"

### What are the resource requirements for pods?
- Assuming 0.5 CPU, 256 MI, 
- This is the minimum requested by the container
- If you need more, you can specify them in the pod defintion file under spec:

```
resources:
    requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: 1
```

You can set up limits on Resources as well under resources section:
```
limits:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: 2
```

If it tries to exceed the limits, it throttles so it avoids going above the limit. The memory is only exception. If tries to go above the memory, then it will terminate the pod all together.
