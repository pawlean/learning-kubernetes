# Stateful Set

These are used to run **stateful**, replicated services like Databases inside K8 cluster.

- Confirgured like other Kubernetes Objects with apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec.

## How stateful sets work

1. Each pod created from a stateful set gets an assigned unquie ID
2. This ID sticks to the pod even when its rescheduled to another worker node
3. This ID allows the pod to keep the connection to the volume that holds the state of the database

- The volume must be remote, persistent disk, outside of the cluster
