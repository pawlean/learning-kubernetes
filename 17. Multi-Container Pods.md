# Multi-Container Pods

Decoupling monolith application into microservices allows us to maintain things, scale, modify each service as required rather than just the whole application.

You may need two services to work together. 
These services may need to be maintained together, scaled together etc.
This is why you have multi-container pods.

This mutli-container pod (because usually, a pod only contains one container) can:
- Share same network space
- Share storage

To create this, you have to add to the pod-definition.yaml file under container:

```
spec:
    containers:
    - name: simple-webapp
    image: simple-webapp
    ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    
    - name: log-agent
    image: log-agent
```

## Sidecar
Sidecar pattern
- Deploying the logging agent to the web server which then sends the logs to a seperate log server
- Multiple apps with loads of logging agents and different formats... sending to the log server. 
- To make sure that all the logs are the same format, then you can use the Adapter container that makes it all the same.
- Ambassador: your application interacts with different databases at different times. You have Dev, Test, Prod DBs. The connectivity is configured in the application. You can outsource this  effort via Ambassador container. 

Sidecar -> Adapter -> Ambassador

To create these designs, you just have to put them all in the pod-definition file as different containers

A good blog post that explains this well: https://www.magalix.com/blog/the-sidecar-pattern 

"A sidecar is just a container that runs on the same Pod as the application container, because it shares the same volume and network as the main container, it can “help” or enhance how the application operates."
