# Container Logging & Monitoring

When you create a pod, and run the `kubectl logs` command you find logs relating to your pod.

Example command:
`kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod`

If you have two containers in your pod, which container will it show? You must specify the name of the container in the command

`kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod event-simular`

# Monitoring Kubernetes

What would you like to monitor? Node level metrics? Performance metrics? CPU/Disk Utilisation?

Kubernetes doens't have a monitoring built-in solution

Metrics server, Prometheus, Elastic Stack, DataDog, Dynatrace are open-source options.

## Metrics Server

- Only one per kubernetes cluster
- It is an in-memory solution
- You cannot see historic data
- Kubelet recieves instructions from the master server
- cAdvisor takes performance metrics, exposues to kubelet API
- You may have to install metrics server

`kubectl top node`
`kubectl top pod`
