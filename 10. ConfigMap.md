# 10. ConfigMap & Secret

- ConfigMap is a properties file for your application e.g. application environment (prod, dev, int) all have different `database_url` so instead of editing it for every environment...you can use ConfigMap - which when you make modifications - you just need to restart the application pod/container rather than redeploying the application.
- ConfigMap can be set up using a YAML file with apiVersion, kind, metadata, data.
- This configmap file can then be referanced in a pod yaml file under `configMapKeyRef`

## Secrets

- Similar to ConfigMap but are encrypted
- You create Secrets using the same format at ConfigMap but specifiying the object as Secret
- You can reference this secret via `secretKeyRef`

## Mounting

Both Secrets and ConfigMap will need to be mounted as a volume into the pod if using files e.g. a cacert.pem file or a config file

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
  type: Opaque
data:
  cacert.pem |
     base-64-encoded value of a PEM certificate
```

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app-image
    volumeMounts:
      - name: certificate-file
        mountPath: /etc/secret
  volumes:
  - name: certificate-file
    configMap:
      name: my-secret
```
