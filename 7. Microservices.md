# 7. Microservices

This is a great way to seperate different parts of your application. For example, you have:

- a front-end
- a back-end
- a in-memory DB
- a worker
- a persistent DB

You can use the `docker run` command to pull the images from your repo e.g. Docker Hub or ECR for each of these microservices.

## Deploying onto Kubernetes

1. Deploy Containers above - deploy as pods
2. Enable connectivity - create a service to expose an app to another microservice e.g. the in memory DB layer need to be accessed by a worker and front-end. So this is a service that needs to be created. This is ClusterIP version.
3. External Access - create a service to expose the front-facing apps to external users.

**Services are used when an application NEEDS to be exposed**

In real life, deployments definitions are used rather than replicaset/pods individually.
