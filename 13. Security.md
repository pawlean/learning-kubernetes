## Security in Docker

The docker host has users e.g. root users and non-root users. These id of users have security rules. 

Docker image can have security users created too.

Root users in containers limits what the root user in container can do, isn't like host root user. It uses Linux capabilities. 

You can add Linux capabilities using different flags. e.g. `--privllege`

## Security Contexts

- If you set security rules in a pod, all those rules apply to the containers in the pod.
- If pod and container security rules are set, then the contaner rules overide the pod rules

The security context can be added in the spec section of a pod e.g. 
```
spec:
    securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000 (root user)

```
You can also add this whole section on securityContext under containers so that the securitycontext is set up for ONLY containers rather than at the pod level.
