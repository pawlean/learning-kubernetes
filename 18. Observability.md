# Observability
## Readiness and Liveness Probes

At any point in time, pods can be pending, running or containercreating status when you do a kubect get pods

Conditions on a pod
- PodScheduled
- Initialised
- ContainersReady
- Ready 

These can be true or false

All these for more information on the pod for observability
kubectl describe pod is the command for this

When a pod is at it's READY state, that is when the application is ready to accept traffic.  But if an application does take time to be officially ready, then this ready state doesn't make much sense. 

That's when the Readiness Probes comes in.
- HTTP Test readiness probe
- TCP Test (DB)
- Exec Command 

These are better ways to see if an application is ready.
To set this up, you put in the pod definition: 

```
readinessProbe:
    httpGet:/api/ready
    path: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5
    FailureThreshold: 8
```
This allows the kubernetes to set up a test to see if the application is actually ready rather tahn just setting it to a ready state off the back.


TCP Test:
```
readinessProbe:
    topSocket:
    path: 3306
```

Exec Command:
```
readinessProbe:
    exec:
        command:
        - cat
        - /app/
```

How is this useful for a multipod set-up?
- If you set up the readiness probe, when you launch another pod, it will wait until it is actually ready before routing it to users.

## Liveness Probes
This probe tests if the application within the container is healthy. If it's unhealthy, then it will not route people there.

```
livenessprobe:
httpGet: ...

```
