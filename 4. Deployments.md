# 4. Deployments

## What is Deployment?

How would you deploy your application in a production environment? E.g. a web server where you need several of them.

If you want to upgrade your web server, you don't want to upgrade every single one of them manually.

Deployment provides all the instances seamlessly using rolling updates.

- Cluster
  - Deployment
    - Replica Set
      - Pods

## How do you create Deployment?

The definition in the YAML file is exactly the same as ReplicaSet apart from changing the kind to Deployent.

1. Create the deployment `kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yml`
2. Check the deployment `kubectl get deployments`
3. Check the replica sets created by the deployment `kubectl get replicaset`
4. Check the pods that was created by the deployment `kubectl get pods`

_VERY_ similar to ReplicaSet.

## Useful commands

`kubectl get all`
This shows you all the objects you've created in the cluster.
