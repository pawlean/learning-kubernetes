# 4. Deployments

## What is Deployment?

How would you deploy your application in a production environment? E.g. a web server where you need several of them.

If you want to upgrade your web server, you don't want to upgrade every single one of them manually.

Deployment provides all the instances seamlessly using rolling updates.

- Cluster
  - Deployment
    - Replica Set
      - Pods

## How do you create Deployment?

The definition in the YAML file is exactly the same as ReplicaSet apart from changing the kind to Deployent.

1. Create the deployment `kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yml`
2. Check the deployment `kubectl get deployments`
3. Check the replica sets created by the deployment `kubectl get replicaset`
4. Check the pods that was created by the deployment `kubectl get pods`

_VERY_ similar to ReplicaSet.

## Useful commands

`kubectl get all`
This shows you all the objects you've created in the cluster.

## Updates and Rollback

A new roll out is triggered when you run the deployment definition every single time.

It keeps track of what happens in our deployment.

`kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app-deployment`

`kubectl rollout history deployment/my-app-deployment`

### Deployment Strategies

1. _Recreate strategy_ destroy old, then launch new but there is a application down time
2. _Rolling update_ Take one old then launch new one. Seamless!

If you don't specify which strategy, it is automatically rolling update.

## How do you update the deployment?

Once change the deployment definition, you can use the command to apply changes:

`kubectl apply`

or

`kubecyl set image deployment/app-deployment/nginx etc`
**This is not recommended because the definition will be different**

## Rollback

`kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment`

This undos the last apply
