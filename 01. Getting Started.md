# 1. Getting Started

## What is Kubernetes?

- Open source container orchestration tool
- Organises/manages docker containers
- Helps you manage containerised applications (applications that are in docker)
- You can manage them om different deployment environments (cloud, physical, hybrid)

## Problems solved?

- Microservices
- Resulted in applications that are in containers
- Difficult to manage all of them as you have more containers

## Kubernetes:

- High Availability - no downtime
- Scalability - high performance (scales with more load)
- Diaster recovery, back up and restore

## Kubernetes architecture:

### One master node

Runs important K8s processes to manage clusters

- API server (a container) - the entry point to K8s cluster (UI/API/CLI all talks to the API server)
- Controller manager - keeps track of what's happening in the cluster
- Scheduler - ensures pods placement
- Etcd - key-value store, current stage of the cluster (recover for DR)
- In prod, should have more than one master nodes. For DR.
- Virtual network spans across all the nodes, this turns the nodes into one powerful machine

### A couple of worker nodes

- Had docker containers
- This is where your applications are running
- Inside the worker nodes, you have kubelets installed
- Makes it possible for other workers to talk to each other

### Pods, Service, Ingress

#### Nodes and Pods

- A node is a server (can be physical or virtual)
- A pod is an abstraction over container - it is a running environment, a layer ontp of the container. It is the smallest unit of K8s. You only interact with the K8 layer of the pod. A pod usually only has one application.
- Each pod gets it's own IP address, each pod can communicate with each other.
- A pod is ifemeral which means if you lose one, you lose the application, your pod gets a new pod, but then you have to adjust the IP address.

#### Service

- To solve this, you use Service
- This is basically a static IP address (permanent) can be attached to its only pod.
- The lifecycle of pod and service are not connected (so if pod dies, then service stays, you dont have to change any endpoint)
- To access the application that is in the pod, you can use service but the URL is ugly: e.g. http://myapp-in-pod.com:port
- It is also a load balancer

#### Ingress

- To solve this, you use ingress.
- Gives you a URL e.g. https://my-app.com

#### Config Map

- ConfigMap component helps you with external configuration of your application e.g. DB_URL = connects to the pod, so you have to just change config in the ConfigMap.
- Keeps variables!
- Don't put creds in ConfigMap!!

#### Secret

- Like configMap
- But used to store secret data
- Not stored in plain text format, base64 encoded
- You can connect it to pod, so they can read it.

#### Volumes

- Data storage
- If you have a pod with a database and the pod restarts, then the data storage is lost.
- That's not good! So need an alternative!
- You want persistent data
- You use Volumes for this
- Attaches a physical storage to your pod e.g. a local machine, remote storage eg. Outside cluster (cloud/prem)
- It is like an external hard drive because K8s doesn't manage data persistence

##### Deployment and Stateful Set

- Everything is replicated in another node
- The replica can be used in the event one node goes down by using service which acts like a load balancer
- You can define a blueprint for pods e.g. my-app pod. This blueprint is called Deployment. You create Deployments. This specify components. It is a layer of abstraction.
- Deployments are mostly used in practice.
- You can't replicate databases using Deployment! Because database has a state (I.e. its data)
- StatefulSet component helps with this.
- This is for Stateful apps I.e. databases e.g. MySQL, mongoDB, elastic search
- Creates a replicas for the pod for stateful apps, scalling them down and up. Reads and writes are updated and not inconsistent.
- This isn't easy!!!! More difficult.
- Common practice to host DB outside the cluster.
