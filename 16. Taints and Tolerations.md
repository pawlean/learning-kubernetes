# Taints and Tolerations
The Scheduler in Kubernetes puts the pods into nodes
The pods are put in equally if not specified
But you can specify it e.g. all the pods need to be in a specific node 
You can prevent what pods go into a node by tainting the node
By default, pods do not have tolerations (i.e. they can't tolerate the tainting so don't go into the tainted node)
Taints can be labelled e.g. Taint=blue
No unwanted pods will be placed on this node
You can add a toleration to a pod to allow it be placed to tained pods e.g. toleration for blue taint, it goes to tainted blue node. 
The scheduler places pods via this taint/toleration.

You can taint nodes via the kubectl command:
`kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect`
taint-effect:
- NoSchedule
- PreferNoSchedule
- NoExecute

kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule

To add a Toleration to the pod, you can load up the pod-definition.yaml file and add the tolerations part in spec:

```
tolerations:
- key: "app"
operator: "Equal"
value: "blue"
effect: "NoSchedule"
```

Restricting nodes from accepting pods
But doesn't guarntee that pods go to a specific node
If you do want that guarntee, you need to use Node Affinity.

The master node has a taint on it that prevents it from acceting ANY pods at all. This is why the master node does not house any pods. To see this taint, run:

`kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint`
__

# Node Selectors 
This allows pods to go to a specific node.
You have to edit the definition file (yaml file) and add a new property in the spec section:
```
nodeSelector:
    size: Large
```
This is mapped to the Largest node (automatically labeled for you by Kubernetes)

You can also label node via
`kubectl label nodes <name> <label-key>=<label-value>`

Limitation: single label, but if requirements more complex (e.g. place pod in large or medium node...) you cannot do this with node selectors. Node Affinity is the best place to go.

# Node Affinity 

```
affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
                - key: size
                  operator: In # ensures the pod will be put in the node that has any values below
                  values:
                  - Large
                  - Medium # Large or Medium 
```

operator can be: NotIn
values: small
This means not SMALL but anything but SMALL.

Types of Node Affinity:
Avaliable
- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
- preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

DuringScheduling = pod does not exist but is created for the first time. If required, the pod needs to be placed a very cruical node. If preffered, this is a way of telling the scheudler to try their best to place the pod in the right node. if not it's OK.
DuringExecution = pod is running currently. 

Planned
- requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution

There can be a mix of Taints and Tolerations and Node Affinity
